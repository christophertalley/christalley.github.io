    BIO:
</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to my GitHub page. This is where I will be tracking my progress as continue my programming adventure. Before
    I pursued web development, I studied Civil Engineering and worked at a design firm located here in Birmingham, AL.
    In my free time I enjoy shooting billiards, playing basketball with some friends, or hiking on the beautiful trails
    that Alabama has to offer.

    I decided to pursue full stack web deveolpment because I have always loved solving problems. In the last job I help,
    I just felt like there was more I could be doing.
    Since I have started my journey, I can honestly say coding has really become a passion for me. There is nothing
    quite like the feeling of successfuly finding the answer to a coding problem.
    Im very excited to continue my journey and be able to conquer more complex problems.
